### Challenge 2 - Reverse a string

# Reverse a string in place. In other words, do not create a new string or use other methods on the string such as `reverse`. The goal of the problem is to use a loop and the string accessors to figure out which values to swap for other values. Below is some sample output.
#
# ```
# Enter a string:
# reverse_me
# em_esrever
# ```

def reverse(str)
  str.each_char.map.with_index do |c, i|
    str[str.length-i]
  end.join()
end

puts reverse('reverse_me')
